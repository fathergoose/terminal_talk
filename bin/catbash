echo *

for f in *
## [[ ]] performs conditional expression on $f
## -d is one of bash's built in evaluators
## The || keeps echo "$f" from happening if $f is a dir
## this tecnique keeps out directories
#do [[ -d "$f" ]] || echo "$f"
## But this option will just allow regular files
do [[ -f "$f" ]] && echo "$f"
done
